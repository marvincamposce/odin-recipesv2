    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon or apple pie spice</li>
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup confectioners sugar</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Beat 1 cup butter in a large bowl with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the white sugar and salt. Beat on medium 2 minutes, scraping bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Beat in egg and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour on low speed.</li>
        <li>Remove dough from mixer and place on plastic wrap. Shape into a rectangle. Wrap dough in plastic wrap; chill until easy to handle (at least 1 hour)</li>
        <li>Generously flour the dough and roll to a 12x10-inch rectangle on a large, floured piece of parchment paper</li>
        <li>Brush dough with the lightly beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Stir together brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over dough.</li>
        <li>Tightly roll up dough, starting from a long side.</li>
        <li>Wrap roll in plastic wrap and place on a baking sheet or tray. Freeze 30 minutes or until firm enough to slice.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Cut roll of cookies using a thin-bladed, serrated knife into 1/4-inch slices.</li>
        <li>Place 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. Bake cookies until set and light browned on the bottoms, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on cookie sheet 1 minute. Remove; cool on wire rack.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare icing. Whisk together cream cheese and the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir in confectioners sugar and enough cream to make an icing of drizzling consistency.</li>
        <li>Drizzle cooled cookies with cream cheese icing.</li>
    </ol>
